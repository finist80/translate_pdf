2.  Ensure you have vscode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

# Set up repo:
1. Next to the the name of the repo, 'template', click the more options then "clone":



	Open Anaconda Prompt from ‘Start’ -> ‘Anaconda3 (64 bit)’ -> ‘Anaconda Prompt’, enter “conda init”.
After Anaconda is installed, the next step is to create the Anaconda environment which will install all the necessary package dependencies. To do this, you will need to open a Command Prompt window. You can search for Command Prompt from the windows start menu to open the Command Prompt.
Here is link for the Anaconda environment file on sharepoint: sfile_wrts.yml. We will use this file later so please copy this file to your local location.
From the Command Prompt you type or paste the command seen below after replacing “C:\path\to\sfile_wrts.yml” with the path to the .yml file on your machine:
•	conda env create -f C:\path\to\sfile_wrts.yml
